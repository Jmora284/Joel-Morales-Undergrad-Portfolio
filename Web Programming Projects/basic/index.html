			This webpage is currently being used for a school project.
			I hope to become sufficient in html to create my own application page one day. The page I am creating is a for a burger joint,
			you can mix and match items from the menu.
								  <br>
								  <br>
			
			The navigation at the top of the page allows a visitor to browse the menu, view prices and various food combos.
			 In order to "place an order", however, a customer is required.
