  <h3>Welcome to Big Boys Burgers!</h3>
  <p>
    This webpage is currently being used for a school project.
	I hope to become sufficient in html to create my own application page one day. The page I am creating is a for a burger joint,
	you can mix and match items from the menu.
  </p>
   <p> 
   The navigation at the top of the page allows a visitor to browse the menu, view prices and various food combos.
   In order to "place an order", however, a customer is required.
